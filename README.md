# FindATutor-frontend
 This project focuses on developing a platform that connects teachers and students for offline learning, addressing the challenges faced in the current educational system. Many teachers struggle to find students due to reliance on brokers, who charge high commissions of up to 30%. This platform eliminates the need for intermediaries, enabling teachers and students to connect directly, lowering costs for students and boosting teachers' earnings.  The platform will feature user registration, search and matching systems, booking and payment integration, and reviews. It offers a transparent, efficient, and user-friendly solution for both teachers and students. By providing a direct connection between educators and learners, this platform aims to improve offline learning experiences, increase accessibility to quality education, and foster trust through better communication and reduced costs.
